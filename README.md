# Themalize

## Modern CSS for quickly designing color-schemed websites.

**Themalize.css** combines consistent styles for typography, forms, buttons and tables with alternative color-schemes for light or dark mode viewing to provide a foundation style sheet for quickly designing color-schemed websites. Edit the global CSS variables used to customize the styles and colors to suit project parameters, or recompile  the style sheet using the Sass source files included.

## A flexible framework for customizing and expanding.

The Sass source files include pre-styled utilities and components designed consistently as optional extensions for the foundation styles, import these selectively through the `_configuration.scss` file when recompiling, and/or customize the property values for the styles and colors via the `_properties.scss` file. Scripts required are included in the `[assets/js]` directory.

<h2 align="center">CSS for designing, building and customizing modern color-schemed websites.</h2>

Themalize provides consistent styles for typography, forms, buttons and tables designed with theme optimized light and dark mode color-schemes, and a variety of optional utilities and pre-styled components. Built with Sass and setup to enable importing over 70 different elements selectively when compiling, also includes compiled style sheets with the `assets` for editing as regular CSS.

See the website [Themalize.com](https://themalize.com) for a demonstration of all the elements included as styled, also includes HTML examples on usage and an overview of customizing the styles to suit specific project parameters.

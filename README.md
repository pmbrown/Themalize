# Themalize

Themalize provides consistent styles for typography, forms, buttons and tables designed with theme optimized light and dark mode color-schemes, and a variety of optional utilities and pre-styled components.

Despite this project having no stars, no documentation and development 'officially' discontinued in February 2025, the repository gets a consistent flow of traffic and is still being cloned on a regular basis so I've made some minor updates (27 July 2025) to correct some redundant code and improve the Sass structure.

I might re-write some of the styles in the future to make use of knowledge gained in both CSS and Sass whilst developing StyleMods (see below), that's me in a roundabout way saying there's a lot about Themalize's code that could be streamlined and improved.

If the repository was to start getting stars that matched the unusual traffic I might be encouraged to prioritize that process and maybe expand the styles, so if you are interested in the project being further developed please feel free to star the project and/or provide some feedback in the repositories discussions forum.


## StyleMods <br><small>[https://stylemods.com](https://stylemods.com)</small>

StyleMods takes a different approach in how the styles are written and the way they're compiled as Sass modules. As a system it provides a lot more flexibility and includes a much larger library of styles for anyone interested in a more modular approach to CSS design using Sass.

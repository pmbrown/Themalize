<h1>Update 17 Feb 2025</h1>

After discovering the flexibility of using Sass modules I've discontinued updating Themalize in favour of updating and maintaining StyleMods (https://github.com/pmbrown/StyleMods). Whilst I'd originally planned to convert Themalize over to modules after making the last update as a hobbyist it was more practical for me to learn about Sass modules starting with a blank slate than re-engineer something that worked ok as-is. 

The repository will stay public for anyone still interested in using Themalize as is described below, but the documentation website has now been disabled. My profile shares my contact information so please feel free to email if you have any questions.

Themalize provides consistent styles for typography, forms, buttons and tables designed with theme optimized light and dark mode color-schemes, and a variety of optional utilities and pre-styled components. Built with Sass and setup to enable importing over 70 different elements selectively when compiling, also includes compiled style sheets with the `assets` for editing as regular CSS.
